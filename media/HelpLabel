A label or tag is to help you organize your tasks. You can indicate them using
;label
;lb

To add a label to a task, you need to create a label first. So,
;label ;add Important

would create a label called 'Important'.

Then to add label to a task, simply mention label when creating a task.
e.g.
;add Buy eggs ;label Important

You can also add label by editing details of a task. 
e.g. For Task with ID = 2,
;edit 2 ;label Extra
(Make sure 'Extra' label is created beforehand.)
